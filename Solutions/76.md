# LeetCode 76: Minimum Window Substring

---

## 1. Intuition

The problem requires finding the minimum window in string `s` that contains all characters of string `t` (including duplicates). The optimal approach for such substring problems is usually the **sliding window** technique.

The key idea:
- Expand the right pointer of the window until all characters in `t` are included in the window.
- Once all characters are covered, contract the left pointer to minimize the window size while maintaining the condition that all characters in `t` are present.
- Track the smallest window during this process.

---

## 2. Main Algorithm and Complexity Analysis

### Algorithm
1. **Character Count Map**:
   - Use a hash map (`mapT`) to store the frequency of each character in `t`.
   - Use another hash map (`mapS`) to track the frequency of characters in the current window.

2. **Sliding Window**:
   - Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the window boundaries.
   - Expand the `right` pointer to include characters in the window until all characters of `t` are satisfied.
   - Once valid, shrink the window from the `left` while keeping it valid and track the minimum window size.

3. **Validation**:
   - Use a counter to track how many characters in `t` have been fully matched in the window.
   - A character is fully matched when its frequency in `mapS` is equal to or greater than in `mapT`.

4. **Result**:
   - Keep updating the minimum window length and its starting position whenever a smaller valid window is found.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(|s| + |t|)\):
  - Both pointers traverse the string `s` at most once.
  - Filling the frequency map for `t` takes \(O(|t|)\).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(|t| + k)\), where \(k\) is the number of unique characters in `s`.

## 3. Important Notes

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `t` is larger than `s`, return an empty string.
  - If `s` or `t` is empty, return an empty string.
- **Duplicates**:
  - Ensure that the window contains at least the required number of duplicates for each character in `t`.

## Code Implementation (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public String minWindow(String s, String t) {
        int[] mapT = new int[128]; // Frequency map for t
        int[] mapS = new int[128]; // Frequency map for the current window
        
        // Fill mapT with the frequency of each character in t
        for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
            mapT[c]++;
        }
        
        int countT = 0; // Number of unique characters in t with non-zero frequency
        for (int freq : mapT) {
            if (freq > 0) countT++;
        }
        
        int left = 0, minLength = Integer.MAX_VALUE, matched = 0;
        int startIndex = 0; // To store the start of the minimum window
        
        for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
            char rightChar = s.charAt(right);
            mapS[rightChar]++;
            
            // If a character from t is fully matched in the window
            if (mapT[rightChar] > 0 && mapS[rightChar] == mapT[rightChar]) {
                matched++;
            }
            
            // Shrink the window from the left while it's valid
            while (matched == countT) {
                if (right - left + 1 < minLength) {
                    minLength = right - left + 1;
                    startIndex = left;
                }
                
                char leftChar = s.charAt(left);
                mapS[leftChar]--;
                
                if (mapT[leftChar] > 0 && mapS[leftChar] < mapT[leftChar]) {
                    matched--;
                }
                
                left++;
            }
        }
        
        return minLength == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? "" : s.substring(startIndex, startIndex + minLength);
    }
}
