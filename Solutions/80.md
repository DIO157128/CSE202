# LeetCode 80: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II

---

## 1. Intuition

The problem asks us to modify a sorted array *in-place* such that each unique element appears at most twice. A naive approach would involve creating a new array and populating it while checking the count of each number, but that would require \(O(n)\) extra space, violating the constraints.

The key observation here is:
- Since the array is sorted, duplicates will appear consecutively. This allows us to track the count of occurrences of each number while iterating through the array in one pass.
- To achieve the in-place requirement, we can use a **two-pointer technique**:
  - One pointer (`i`) traverses the array.
  - The other pointer (`pos`) indicates the position in the array where the next valid element should be placed.

This eliminates the need for extra space and ensures that the array is updated correctly.

## 2. Main Algorithm and Complexity Analysis

### Algorithm
1. Initialize a pointer `pos = 0` to track the position of the next valid element in the array.
2. Iterate through the array with an index `i`:
   - For each element, check if it can be added to the array:
     - It can be added if `pos < 2` (first two elements are always valid) or if the current element is different from the element two places before `pos`.
   - If valid, place the current element at `nums[pos]` and increment `pos`.
3. Return `pos` as the length of the modified array.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\) — We make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) — No additional data structures are used.

## 3. Important Notes

- **Maintaining order**: The algorithm ensures the relative order of elements is preserved because the overwriting happens sequentially.
- **Edge cases**:
  - An empty array: Return 0.
  - Arrays with fewer than 3 elements: Directly return the length since no duplicates need to be removed.
- **Two-pointer optimization**: This technique allows efficient in-place updates without the need for auxiliary storage.

## Code Implementation (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int pos = 0; // Tracks the position to write the next valid element
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            // If the position is less than 2, or the current number is different
            // from the element two places before `pos`
            if (pos < 2 || num != nums[pos - 2]) {
                nums[pos++] = num; // Write the number and increment `pos`
            }
        }
        
        return pos; // `pos` is the new length of the modified array
    }
}
