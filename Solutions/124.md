# LeetCode 124: Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

---

## 1. Intuition

The problem asks us to find the maximum path sum in a binary tree. A path is defined as any sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes is connected by an edge. This path does not need to start at the root or end at a leaf. 

The key observation is:
- At each node, the maximum path sum could either:
  1. Include only the left subtree, the right subtree, or just the node itself.
  2. Include both left and right subtrees (creating a split at the current node).

To solve this problem efficiently:
- Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal, calculating the maximum gain (sum) from each node's left and right subtrees.
- At each node, update a global variable (`max`) to store the maximum path sum found so far.

---

## 2. Main Algorithm and Complexity Analysis

### Algorithm

1. Define a global variable `max` initialized to `Integer.MIN_VALUE` to store the maximum path sum.
2. Use a helper function `dfs(TreeNode node)` that computes:
   - The maximum path sum from the current node's left and right subtrees, ignoring any negative values (replace them with `0`).
   - Update the global `max` with the value of the current node's split path (i.e., `node.val + left + right`).
   - Return the maximum single-side path gain: `node.val + max(left, right)` to propagate to the parent.
3. Traverse the tree recursively, and update `max` at each node.
4. Return `max` as the result.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\) — Each node is visited once during the DFS traversal.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(h)\) — The recursion stack's depth is proportional to the tree's height, where \(h\) is the height of the tree.

## 3. Important Notes

- **Handling negative values**: If the path sum through a subtree is negative, we ignore it by taking `max(0, ...)`.
- **Split path logic**: When computing the maximum path sum at a node, consider the case where the path "splits" at the node (i.e., includes both left and right subtrees).
- **Global state**: Use a global variable to store the overall maximum path sum while recursing through the tree.

## Code Implementation (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE; // Global variable to track the maximum path sum
    
    public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        dfs(root); // Start DFS traversal
        return max; // Return the maximum path sum
    }
    
    private int dfs(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return 0; // Base case: return 0 for null nodes
        }
        
        // Recursively calculate the maximum path sum from left and right subtrees
        int left = Math.max(dfs(node.left), 0); // Ignore negative paths
        int right = Math.max(dfs(node.right), 0);
        
        // Update the global max with the sum including the current node
        max = Math.max(max, node.val + left + right);
        
        // Return the maximum single-side path sum
        return Math.max(node.val + left, node.val + right);
    }
