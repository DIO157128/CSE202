# LeetCode 42: Trapping Rain Water

---

## 1. Intuition

The problem asks us to compute how much water can be trapped between the bars of a given elevation map after it rains. The key observation is:
- The amount of water trapped at any position is determined by the **minimum** of the maximum heights to its left and right minus the height of the bar at that position.
- The most efficient way to calculate this is by using the **two-pointer technique**, which avoids precomputing arrays for left and right maximums.

## 2. Main Algorithm and Complexity Analysis

### Algorithm
1. **Two Pointers**:
   - Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, initialized to the two ends of the elevation array.
   - Use variables `preMax` and `sufMax` to track the maximum height encountered from the left and right, respectively.
   - Iterate until `left` meets `right`:
     - Compare `preMax` and `sufMax`:
       - If `preMax < sufMax`, calculate the water trapped at `left` and move the `left` pointer.
       - Otherwise, calculate the water trapped at `right` and move the `right` pointer.

2. **Water Trapping Logic**:
   - For each position, calculate the water trapped as `min(preMax, sufMax) - height[position]`.
   - Accumulate the result into a variable `ans`.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\) — The two pointers traverse the array at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) — No additional space is used apart from a few variables.

## 3. Important Notes

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If the array length is less than 3, return 0 since no water can be trapped.
  - Arrays with all bars of the same height trap no water.
- **Efficiency**:
  - The two-pointer approach is more space-efficient than precomputing left and right maximum arrays (\(O(n)\) space).
- **Validation**:
  - Ensure that the input array contains only non-negative integers.

## Code Implementation (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        int ans = 0;
        int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
        int preMax = 0, sufMax = 0; // Initialize left and right max heights
        
        while (left < right) {
            // Update preMax and sufMax based on current pointers
            preMax = Math.max(preMax, height[left]);
            sufMax = Math.max(sufMax, height[right]);
            
            // Calculate trapped water
            if (preMax < sufMax) {
                ans += preMax - height[left++]; // Water trapped depends on preMax
            } else {
                ans += sufMax - height[right--]; // Water trapped depends on sufMax
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
